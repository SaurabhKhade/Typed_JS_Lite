# Typed_JS_Lite
We all know about typed js which is a javascript library we can use to write set of strings at the given speed, backspace what itâ€™s typed and begin the typing with another string. I have implemented a same thing with pure javascript. It is not perfect like that typed js but i can say that it is more than 50% perfect compared to it and i will go on developing this file and thats why i have given a name TYPED_JS_LITE  :)

function prototype

typed_js_lite(element, texts_array, stable_text = '', write_delay = 500, remove_delay = 500, write_speed_per_character = 100, remove_speed_per_character = 100)

All variables Explained

=> element
an element in which sentences to be written
=> texts_array
Array of sentences which are to be write inside element
=> stable sentence
sentence which will not be modified, it will be as it is like it is hardcoded there
=> write_delay

=> remove_delay

=> write_speed_per_character

=> remove_speed_per_character
